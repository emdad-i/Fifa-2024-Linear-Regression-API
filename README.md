# âš½ Fifa 2024 Linear Regression API

This is a personal learning project to explore how to serve machine learning models using **FastAPI** in Python. The model is trained using **scikit-learn** with a **Linear Regression** algorithm on the **FIFA 2024** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/ea-sports-fc-24-complete-player-dataset).

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Learn how to serve the trained model as an API using FastAPI.
- Practice working with real-world datasets (FIFA 2024).
- Understand the basic lifecycle of a machine learning project from data to deployment.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- FastAPI
- uvicorn
- Kaggle (for dataset)
